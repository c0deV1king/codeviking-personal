steam achievement hunting. it is different than other platforms with stricter rules on the tools you can use... being on a device you cant modify to do what you want. on steam however, it is tougher to compare with other hunters because of tools like SAM; where you can instantly unlock achievements you never earned. but that doesn't stop the true hunters from sticking to their tight communities and showing off their milestones in the achievement hunting scene.

**steam tracker** is a webapp that i created with love for achievement hunting. it grabs your public steam information and games to display your profile which includes your recent games, recent achievements, full game and achievement lists, and an achievement advisor.

i don't expect people to use this as a regular tool, it is mainly for myself to see if i could do something like it.

steam tracker manages and stores thousands of api calls and data entries at one time to give you the most detailed look at what you have going on with your profile and what achievements to work towards next.

so lets take a look at how i did some of the features
